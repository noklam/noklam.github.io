    "> In computer science, a kernel is a fundamental part of an operating system that acts as a bridge between software and hardware. It is a low-level program that controls and manages the resources of a computer, including memory, input/output operations, and system calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The kernel is responsible for handling all requests from applications or other software programs to access the computer's hardware resources, and it provides a layer of abstraction that shields the higher-level software from the complexities of the underlying hardware. In essence, the kernel is the core of the operating system, and it is responsible for managing all of the system's resources and providing a stable and secure platform for running software applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are different types of kernels, including monolithic kernels, microkernels, hybrid kernels, and exokernels. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the specific requirements of the operating system and the hardware it runs on."

    "## What does kernel means in Jupyter  \n",
    "> In the context of Jupyter, a kernel refers to a computational engine that executes the code in a notebook. Each notebook is associated with a kernel that runs the code in the notebook cells and communicates the results back to the notebook interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The kernel in Jupyter is responsible for executing the code in the notebook cells, managing the state of the kernel session, and communicating with the notebook interface. The kernel provides the computing power for the notebook and enables the user to interact with the notebook in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are many different kernels available for use with Jupyter, including kernels for Python, R, Julia, and many other programming languages. Each kernel is specific to the language it supports and provides the necessary tools and libraries to execute code in that language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's the difference?\n",
    "> The main difference between the kernel in Jupyter and the kernel in an operating system is that the Jupyter kernel is a software component that runs within the Jupyter environment, whereas the operating system kernel is a low-level program that manages the computer's resources. While both kernels have different functions and operate at different levels of the computing stack, they are both critical components of their respective systems."

    "## Hmm... Okay, so what's does a \"Kernel\" includes - particular the Python Kernel?\n",
    "> In the case of Python, the kernel provides a few key features that a standard Python interpreter does not. These include:\n",
    "> Code execution within an isolated process: When a user runs code in a Jupyter notebook, the kernel executes that code within an isolated process, separate from the notebook interface. This allows the kernel to manage the state of the Python session independently of the notebook, providing greater stability and reliability.\n",
    "> Input and output history: The Jupyter kernel maintains a history of inputs and outputs from previous notebook sessions, allowing users to recall and reuse previous code snippets and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Rich media display: The kernel provides support for displaying rich media content within the notebook, including images, videos, and interactive visualizations. This allows users to create more dynamic and interactive notebooks that incorporate multimedia elements.\n",
    "> Support for multiple languages: The Jupyter kernel supports many different programming languages, allowing users to write and execute code in the language of their choice within the same notebook interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "> While it is possible to run a Python interpreter outside of Jupyter, using the Jupyter kernel provides many additional features and benefits that are not available in a standard Python interpreter. These features make Jupyter a powerful tool for data analysis, scientific computing, and interactive programming."

    "## Okay, so what happens when I make a plot in Jupyter?\n",
    "> When a user runs a cell in a Jupyter notebook that contains a call to one of these display functions, the kernel executes the Python code and generates the requested media object. The kernel then sends the media object to the notebook interface using the display protocol, which displays the object in the notebook.\n",
    "> The communication between Jupyter and Python is supported by a messaging protocol called the \"Jupyter protocol\". The Jupyter protocol is a messaging protocol that allows for bidirectional communication between the Jupyter notebook interface and the kernel that is running the Python process.\n",
    "> When a user interacts with a Jupyter notebook, the notebook interface sends messages to the kernel, requesting that code be executed and displaying the results of that code. The kernel receives these messages, executes the requested code, and sends the results back to the notebook interface. The notebook interface then displays the results in the appropriate format, such as text output, plots, or interactive visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the Jupyter ecosystem, ZeroMQ is used to establish a \"wire protocol\" between the notebook interface and the kernel. The wire protocol specifies the format of the messages that are sent between the notebook and the kernel, and how those messages are encoded and decoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The wire protocol is implemented using ZeroMQ sockets, which provide a reliable, low-latency communication channel between the notebook interface and the kernel. The sockets are used to send and receive messages in real-time, allowing the user to interact with the notebook interface and see the results of code execution immediately.\n",
